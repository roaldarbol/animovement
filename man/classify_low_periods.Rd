\title{Classifies Periods of Low Activity in Time Series Using Peaks and Troughs}
\usage{
classify_low_periods(peaks, troughs)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks}{logical vector; TRUE indicates peak positions}

\item{troughs}{logical vector; same length as peaks, TRUE indicates trough positions}
}
\value{
logical vector; TRUE indicates periods of low activity
}
\description{
Identifies periods of low activity in a time series by analyzing peaks and troughs,
returning a logical vector marking these periods. Low activity periods are defined
as regions between consecutive troughs that contain no peaks.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Validates input lengths
\item Initializes all periods as potentially low activity (TRUE)
\item For each pair of consecutive troughs:
\itemize{
\item If no peaks exist between them, maintains TRUE for that period
\item If any peaks exist, marks that period as FALSE (not low activity)
}
}
}
\examples{
peaks <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)
troughs <- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
classify_low_periods(peaks, troughs)

}
