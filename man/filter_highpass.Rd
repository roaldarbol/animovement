\title{Apply Butterworth Highpass Filter to Signal}
\usage{
filter_highpass(x, cutoff_freq, sampling_rate, order = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector containing the signal to be filtered}

\item{cutoff_freq}{Cutoff frequency in Hz. Frequencies above this value are passed,
while frequencies below are attenuated. Should be between 0 and sampling_rate/2.}

\item{sampling_rate}{Sampling rate of the signal in Hz. Must be at
least twice the highest frequency component in the signal (Nyquist criterion).}

\item{order}{Filter order (default = 4). Controls the steepness of frequency rolloff:
- Higher orders give sharper cutoffs but may introduce more ringing
- Lower orders give smoother transitions but less steep rolloff
- Common values in practice are 2-8
- Values above 8 are rarely used due to numerical instability}

\item{na_action}{How to handle NA values:
- "interpolate": Linear interpolation of NAs (default)
- "remove": Remove NAs and adjust time indices
- "error": Raise an error if NAs are present}
}
\value{
Numeric vector containing the filtered signal

\description{
This function applies a highpass Butterworth filter to a signal using forward-backward
filtering (filtfilt) to achieve zero phase distortion. The Butterworth filter is
maximally flat in the passband, making it ideal for many signal processing applications.
}
\details{
The Butterworth filter response falls off at -6*order dB/octave. The cutoff frequency
corresponds to the -3dB point of the filter's magnitude response.

Common Applications:
\itemize{
\item Removing baseline drift: Use low cutoff (0.1-1 Hz)
\item EMG analysis: Use moderate cutoff (10-20 Hz)
\item Motion artifact removal: Use application-specific cutoff
}

Parameter Selection Guidelines:
\itemize{
\item cutoff_freq: Choose based on the lowest frequency you want to preserve
\item order: Same guidelines as lowpass_filter
}

Common values by field:
\itemize{
\item ECG processing: order=2, cutoff=0.5 Hz
\item EEG analysis: order=4, cutoff=1 Hz
\item Mechanical vibrations: order=2, cutoff application-specific
}

Missing Value Handling:
See lowpass_filter documentation for details on NA handling approaches.

\examples{
# Generate example signal with drift
t <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.001)
drift <- 0.5 * t  # Linear drift
signal <- sin(2*pi*10*t)  # 10 Hz signal
x <- signal + drift

# Remove drift with highpass filter
filtered <- filter_highpass(x, cutoff_freq = 2, sampling_rate = 1000, order = 4)
