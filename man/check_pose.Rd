\title{Analyze the distribution of distances from keypoints to the centroid}
\usage{
check_pose(data, reference_keypoint, type = "histogram")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing at least the columns \code{keypoint}, \code{x}, and \code{y}.}

\item{reference_keypoint}{The keypoint used as a reference to calculate the distance.}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the type of plot to create. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"histogram"}: Histograms of the distance distributions (default).
\item \code{"confidence"}: Plots showing confidence intervals for the distances.
}}
}
\value{
A \code{patchwork} object combining plots for each keypoint, visualizing
the distances to the centroid.
}
\description{
This function generates visualizations of the distances from each keypoint to
a calculated centroid in the data. By default, it produces histograms of the
distance distributions, but it can also create confidence plots if specified.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The centroid is computed using the \code{add_centroid} function and distances are
calculated with the \code{calculate_distance_to_centroid} function.
\item The function automatically excludes the centroid itself from the visualizations.
\item Histograms provide an overview of distance distributions, while confidence plots
summarize variability with intervals.
