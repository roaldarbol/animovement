\title{Apply FFT-based Lowpass Filter to Signal}
\usage{
filter_lowpass_fft(
  x,
  cutoff_freq,
  sampling_rate,
  na_action = c("linear", "spline", "stine", "locf", "value", "error"),
  keep_na = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector containing the signal to be filtered}

\item{cutoff_freq}{Cutoff frequency in Hz. Frequencies below this value are passed,
while frequencies above are attenuated. Should be between 0 and sampling_rate/2.}

\item{sampling_rate}{Sampling rate of the signal in Hz. Must be at
least twice the highest frequency component in the signal (Nyquist criterion).}

\item{na_action}{Method to handle NA values before filtering. One of:
- "linear": Linear interpolation (default)
- "spline": Spline interpolation for smoother curves
- "stine": Stineman interpolation preserving data shape
- "locf": Last observation carried forward
- "value": Replace with a constant value
- "error": Raise an error if NAs are present}

\item{keep_na}{Logical indicating whether to restore NAs to their original positions
after filtering (default = FALSE)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to replace_na(). Common options include:
- value: Numeric value for replacement when na_action = "value"
- min_gap: Minimum gap size to interpolate/fill
- max_gap: Maximum gap size to interpolate/fill}
}
\value{
Numeric vector containing the filtered signal
}
\description{
This function implements a lowpass filter using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
It provides a sharp frequency cutoff but may introduce ringing artifacts (Gibbs phenomenon).
}
\details{
FFT-based filtering applies a hard cutoff in the frequency domain. This can be
advantageous for:
\itemize{
\item Precise frequency selection
\item Batch processing of long signals
\item Cases where sharp frequency cutoffs are desired
}

Limitations:
\itemize{
\item May introduce ringing artifacts
\item Assumes periodic signal (can cause edge effects)
\item Less suitable for real-time processing
}

Missing Value Handling:
The function uses replace_na() internally for handling missing values. See ?replace_na
for detailed information about each method and its parameters. NAs can optionally be
restored to their original positions after filtering using keep_na = TRUE.

\examples{
# Generate example signal with mixed frequencies
t <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.001)
x <- sin(2*pi*2*t) + sin(2*pi*50*t)

# Add some NAs
x[sample(length(x), 10)] <- NA

# Basic filtering with linear interpolation for NAs
filtered <- filter_lowpass_fft(x, cutoff_freq = 5, sampling_rate = 1000)

# Using spline interpolation with max gap constraint
filtered <- filter_lowpass_fft(x, cutoff_freq = 5, sampling_rate = 1000,
                              na_action = "spline", max_gap = 3)

# Replace NAs with zeros before filtering
filtered <- filter_lowpass_fft(x, cutoff_freq = 5, sampling_rate = 1000,
                              na_action = "value", value = 0)

# Filter but keep NAs in their original positions
filtered <- filter_lowpass_fft(x, cutoff_freq = 5, sampling_rate = 1000,
                              na_action = "linear", keep_na = TRUE)

# Compare with Butterworth filter
butter_filtered <- filter_lowpass(x, 5, 1000)
