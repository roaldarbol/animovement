\title{Filter values by speed threshold}
\usage{
filter_by_speed(data, threshold = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing at least the columns \code{x} and \code{y}.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value specifying the speed threshold. Observations
with speeds greater than this value will have their \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{confidence}
values replaced with \code{NA}. If set to \code{"auto"}, the function will throw an error
as automatic threshold determination is not yet implemented.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same columns as the input \code{data}, but with
values replaced by \code{NA} where the speed exceeds the threshold.
}
\description{
This function filters out values in a dataset where the calculated speed exceeds
a specified threshold. Values for \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{confidence} are replaced with
\code{NA} if their corresponding speed exceeds the threshold. Speed is calculated
using the \code{calculate_kinematics} function.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The speed is calculated using the \code{calculate_kinematics} function, which
computes translational velocity (\code{v_translation}) and other kinematic parameters.
\item The \code{"auto"} threshold option is currently not implemented and will result
in an error.
\item The output data frame retains the original columns and structure of the input
data.

  confidence = c(0.8, 0.9, 0.7, 0.85, 0.6)
