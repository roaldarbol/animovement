\title{Classifies Periods of High Activity in Time Series Using Peaks and Troughs}
\usage{
classify_high_periods(x, peaks, troughs)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector; the time series values}

\item{peaks}{logical vector; same length as x, TRUE indicates peak positions}

\item{troughs}{logical vector; same length as x, TRUE indicates trough positions}
}
\value{
logical vector; TRUE indicates periods of high activity
}
\description{
Identifies periods of high activity in a time series by analyzing peaks and troughs,
returning a logical vector marking these periods. The function handles special cases
like adjacent peaks and the initial/final sequences.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Resolves adjacent peaks by keeping only the highest
\item Handles the initial sequence before the first trough
\item Handles the final sequence after the last event
\item Identifies regions between troughs containing exactly one peak
}
}
\examples{
x <- c(1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1)
peaks <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
troughs <- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
classify_high_periods(x, peaks, troughs)
