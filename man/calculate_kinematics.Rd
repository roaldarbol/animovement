\title{Calculate kinematics from position data}
\usage{
calculate_kinematics(data, by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing at minimum:
\itemize{
\item time (numeric): Time points of measurements
\item x (numeric): X-coordinates
\item y (numeric): Y-coordinates
}}

\item{by}{Character vector specifying additional grouping variables (optional).
If the input data frame is already grouped, those groups will be preserved
and any additional groups specified in \code{by} will be added.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the original data plus calculated kinematics:
\itemize{
\item distance: Distance traveled between consecutive points
\item v_translation: Translational velocity
\item a_translation: Translational acceleration
\item direction: Movement direction in radians
\item rotation: Angular change between consecutive points
\item v_rotation: Angular velocity
\item a_rotation: Angular acceleration
}
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

Calculates kinematic measurements including translational and rotational motion from
position data. The function computes velocities, accelerations, and angular measurements
from x-y coordinate time series data.

\section{Warning}{

Time points should be regularly sampled for accurate derivatives.

\examples{
# Basic usage with just x-y coordinates
df <- data.frame(
  time = 1:10,
  x = runif(10),
  y = runif(10)
)
calculate_kinematics(df)

# Using with grouping variables
df_grouped <- data.frame(
  time = rep(1:5, 2),
  x = runif(10),
  y = runif(10),
  individual = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 5)
)
calculate_kinematics(df_grouped, by = "individual")
