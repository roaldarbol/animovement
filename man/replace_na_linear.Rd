\title{Replace Missing Values Using Linear Interpolation}
\usage{
replace_na_linear(x, min_gap = 1, max_gap = Inf, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector containing numeric data with missing values (NAs)}

\item{min_gap}{Integer specifying minimum gap size to interpolate. Gaps shorter
than this will be left as NA. Default is 1 (interpolate all gaps).}

\item{max_gap}{Integer or Inf specifying maximum gap size to interpolate. Gaps longer
than this will be left as NA. Default is Inf (no upper limit).}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to stats::approx}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with NA values replaced by interpolated values where
gap length criteria are met.
}
\description{
Replaces missing values using linear interpolation, with control over both
minimum and maximum gap sizes to interpolate.
}
\details{
The function applies both minimum and maximum gap criteria:
\itemize{
\item Gaps shorter than min_gap are left as NA
\item Gaps longer than max_gap are left as NA
\item Only gaps that meet both criteria are interpolated
If both parameters are specified, min_gap must be less than or equal to max_gap.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
x <- c(1, NA, NA, 4, 5, NA, NA, NA, 9)
replace_na_linear(x)  # interpolates all gaps
replace_na_linear(x, min_gap = 2)  # only gaps >= 2
replace_na_linear(x, max_gap = 2)  # only gaps <= 2
replace_na_linear(x, min_gap = 2, max_gap = 3)  # gaps between 2 and 3
}
