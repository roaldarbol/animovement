#' Classifies Periods of High Activity in Time Series Using Peaks and Troughs
#'
#' @description
#' Identifies periods of high activity in a time series by analyzing peaks and troughs,
#' returning a logical vector marking these periods. The function handles special cases
#' like adjacent peaks and the initial/final sequences.
#'
#' @param x numeric vector; the time series values
#' @param peaks logical vector; same length as x, TRUE indicates peak positions
#' @param troughs logical vector; same length as x, TRUE indicates trough positions
#'
#' @return logical vector; TRUE indicates periods of high activity
#'
#' @details
#' The function performs the following steps:
#' 1. Resolves adjacent peaks by keeping only the highest
#' 2. Handles the initial sequence before the first trough
#' 3. Handles the final sequence after the last event
#' 4. Identifies regions between troughs containing exactly one peak
